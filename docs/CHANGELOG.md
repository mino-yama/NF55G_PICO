Initial implementation start:
- Added `src/config.py` constants for frame bytes, timing, retry, cache names, and invalidation policy.
- Added `src/models.py` lightweight shared model classes.
- Added `src/frame.py` for NF55G frame build/parse and BCC calculation.
- Added `src/nf55_decode.py` pure decoders for D0/D1/D2/D3/D4/D5/BC/EB/EL/OL/AR/FD.
- Added `src/cache_manager.py` for power-on invalid cache state, validate/invalidate, refresh failure, and control ambiguous/success invalidation.
- Added initial host `unittest` coverage for frame/BCC, cache, and decode basics.
- Expanded decoder unit tests to cover D0/D1/D2/D3/D4/D5/BC/AR/EL/OL/FD normal lengths, wrong lengths, key numeric conversions, status bit decode, FD raw preservation, and EL/OL START_NO mismatch.
- Added comprehensive D0 Golden Data assertions covering TIME, REALTIME, OFF, LIFE_CALC, LIFE_DIAG, ACCUMULATED, MFG raw/decode, PARAM raw/decode, and STATUS raw/decode.
- Added host-side Mock NF55G with `FakeClock`, `MockUART`, `ResponseFactory`, and scenario steps for ACK, NAK33, ACK_TIMEOUT, RESP_TIMEOUT, BCC NG, PME, SQE, and HWE.
- Added `src/nf55_protocol.py` transaction state machine covering WAIT_ACK, WAIT_RESPONSE, VALIDATE_RESPONSE, COMMAND_RETRY, RESPONSE_RETRY, SUCCESS, and FAILED paths with host unit tests.
- Added control command/cache integration for CHARGE_ON, CHARGE_OFF, BACKUP_ENABLE, OUTPUT_RESTART, PARAM_SET, and related control commands, with tests for success invalidation, parser rejection, PME/SQE no-invalidation, HWE/ambiguous invalidation, and no automatic post-refresh.
- Added Logger/SD core with RAM queue, host memory SD sink, TEST_START/TEST_END, LOG_CONT_START/LOG_CONT_STOP, SD_STATUS?, SD_USAGE?, LOG_DROP_COUNT?, SD_REINIT, forced drain on TEST_END, drop counting, and no write/flush while protocol busy.
- Recorded separate SD real-hardware debug checklist for Mount, CSV creation, Write, Flush, Close, continuous logging, card removal, write error, and reinitialization.
- Added Pico-side RTC command support for RTC_DATE?, RTC_TIME?, RTC_DATETIME?, RTC_SET_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS, and RTC_CHECK? using a DS3231 abstraction, explicitly separate from NF55G SC/CLOCK_SYNC.
- Added Pico/MicroPython `DS3231I2CDevice` access for I2C0 GP20/GP21, including BCD datetime read/write and OSF clear, with host fake-I2C tests.
- Added and consolidated AD/AR Open Issue review notes, including interim FW analysis, into OI-16 through OI-21 plus OI-04/OI-05 refinements for production FW/design confirmation.
- Added HW-01 for the ADA-5703 PiCowbell GP4/GP5 physical conflict with Pico-2CH-RS232 NF55G UART1, and noted that disabling PiCowbell RTC in software is not sufficient.
- Added a first-step real-hardware debug notice and T8 pre-check requiring ADA-5703 GP4/GP5 physical isolation before final fixture UART/SD debug.
- Recorded that 2026-09-04 Pico 2 SD/RTC real-hardware tests were performed with ADA-5703 GP4/GP5 physically isolated; HW-01 remains open for final fixture isolation/inspection traceability.
- Added `docs/Desktop_to_VSC_Migration_Plan.md` to define the Desktop Codex to VSC+Codex scope boundary, migration gate, current status, VSC start checklist, and required real-hardware records.
- Added `docs/Desktop_to_VSC_Migration_Plan.md` to `HANDOFF_MANIFEST.txt`.
- Added `reference/NF55G_VSC_Codex_Migration_Guide.md` as a supporting reference for ChatGPT -> Desktop Codex -> VSC+Codex staged migration, maintained until VSC+Codex handoff and retained as a record afterward.
- Added the VSC+Codex migration guide to `HANDOFF_MANIFEST.txt` as a supporting reference file and clarified generated migration/support notes in `reference/README_REFERENCE.md`.
- Added `scripts/pico_sd_hil.py` as a repeatable Pico 2 MicroPython SD HIL runner for SD mount, CSV write/readback, current logger queue-path verification, and clean SD reinitialization checks.
- Recorded 2026-09-07 Pico 2 SD logger queue-path verification in `docs/Real_Hardware_Test_Log.md`; host `tests.test_logger_sd` passed and Pico 2 SD queue/readback completed with 160 records, 5 flushes, 1 close, and 0 drops.
- Extended `scripts/pico_sd_hil.py` with configurable queue/load record count and an interactive card removal/reinsert mount probe; recorded a 2000-record Pico 2 SD logger load pass with 0 drops.
- Recorded Pico 2 microSD physical removal detection and post-reinsert remount/write/readback recovery; forced write-error injection remains pending.
- Recorded an inconclusive forced write-error attempt: physical removal after opening a MicroPython file did not surface a logger-visible write/flush error after either 1-record or 256-record attempts, so a lower-level fault-injection procedure is still required.
- Recorded final post-fault-attempt SD remount/write/readback recovery on Pico 2, confirming the card returned to normal operation after reinsertion.
- Re-ran Pico 2 SD removal/reinsert checks after the prior physical-removal timing was found uncertain; baseline write/readback, removed-card mount failure, post-reinsert remount, and post-reinsert logger write/readback all passed.
- Added `scripts/pico_uart_hil.py` for Pico 2 MicroPython RS232C 2ch loopback HIL checks and recorded CH0/CH1 init, 256-byte loopback, no-crosstalk, and 100-frame stress PASS results; 512-byte single-write behavior is recorded as a HIL buffering limit observation.
- Added host-testable Pico hardware/transport layer skeletons (`ate_uart.py`, `nf55_uart.py`, `diagnostic.py`, `command_parser.py`, `main.py`) plus tests for local routing, diagnostics, `FW_UPDATE` prohibition, and no-control behavior before NF55G connection.
- Added `scripts/pico_rtc_hil.py` and recorded a pre-NF55G readiness check: host tests passed, RTC/SD/UART HIL checks passed on Pico 2, and remaining work is gated on final fixture isolation evidence, final firmware path, and real NF55G availability.
- Revised Desktop-to-VSC migration and test plans for the 2026-09-07 boundary: Desktop Codex completed host/mock plus Pico 2 RTC/SD/UART REPL HIL; VSC+Codex takes over final firmware placement/build/flash, final-firmware reruns, low-level SD write-error fault injection, and Real NF55G HIL.
